App Description: We are developing an AI tool to assist users in constructing and detailing text messages they want to send. We are targeting this app toward busy users who need to send detailed texts while under time constraints or when they simply need a break from thinking!
This web application is created for the use case of accessible, customizable, and reliable text message suggestions for users through utilizing the Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT3) autoregressive language model developed by OpenAI. 

GPT3 API Documentation:
